# Keyhole Markup Language Parser and Editor

## Final Grade: 100%

## Project Description

This was a semester long project that I worked on for CIS2750 Software Systems Development and Integration. The goal of the project was to create a parser for the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file format. The parser was written in C and was compiled into a shared library. The parser was then used in a Python program that allowed the user to edit the KML file. The Python program was written using the tkinter library.

## How to Run

To compile the parser execute `make parser` and libkmlparser.so will appear in /bin.

To run the program make sure the parser library is compiled, and then go to /bin and execute `python3 A3main.py`
